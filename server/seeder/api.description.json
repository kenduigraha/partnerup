I kinda coincidently landed in that firm and initiated a tough but successful turnaround for this business; significant cost cuts with 30% growth. That way I've gained experience in various fields of management; e.g. fund raising, sales, innovation (nano-tech/composites/food-industry). Though, it's time to move on, and follow my dreams moving to areas I feel very passionate about such as fin tech.",
